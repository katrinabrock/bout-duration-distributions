# Bout duration distributions in mammals

This project ties together results from behavioural classifiers built using [hyenas](), [meerkats](), and eventually [coatis]().
Here, I aim to find bout duration distributions for all classified behaviours for each individual of each species.
This project stems from the serendipitous discovery of heavy-tailed bout duration distributions in spotted hyenas in 2019 by Pranav Minasandra.
