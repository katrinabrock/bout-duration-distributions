# Bout duration distributions in mammals

This project ties together results from behavioural classifiers built using [hyenas](https://github.com/pminasandra/hyena-acc), [meerkats](https://github.com/amlan-nayak/meerkat-box), and eventually [coatis](https://github.com/pminasandra/Coati_ACC_Pipeline).
Here, I aim to find bout duration distributions for all classified behaviours for each individual of each species.
This project stems from the serendipitous discovery of heavy-tailed bout duration distributions in spotted hyenas in 2019 by Pranav Minasandra. 

This project aims to

- find the distributions of bout durations for all behaviours across individuals and species,
- fit various distributions to them using information criteria to prove heavy-tailedness, and
- hope that some sense comes out of this thing.
