# To-Do list

- [x] script to gather data from various sources
- [x] code to parse data, convert to bouts
- [x] sanity check: are all behaviours represented in all individuals, in each species?
- [x] code to fit distributions to data, make plots
- [x] code to plot instantaneous survival rate (or behavioural inertia)
- [x] write docs about behavioural inertia
- [x] simulation to test if classifiers cause heavy-tailedness
- [x] write docs about simulations
- [ ] discussions on how to proceed
- [ ] graphics to more convincingly make these arguments
- [ ] (?) simulation to show effect of biased behavioural proportions
- [ ] (?) simulation/maths to show that this is not just effect of hierarchical organisation
