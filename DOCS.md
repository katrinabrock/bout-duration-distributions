# Directory structure

The following tree of directories is needed on your system. This is generated automatically by setup.sh if you run it on your system.
Note that the data
files are big, and will take up some space.

PROJECTROOT 
  |-- code 
  |-- Data 
      |-- coati
      |-- hyena 
      |-- meerkat
